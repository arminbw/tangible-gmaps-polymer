#Tangible GMaps Polymer
Tangible GMaps Polymer is a stylized Google Map based on Polymer.
This is work in progress.

##Background
A few years ago I was working on a toolset for teachers of visual impaired students. One goal was to ease the production of tangible maps.
To get something up and running fast, I set up a styled Google Maps page. This page served as a source for high-contrast images which were then turned into embossed, tangible maps.
The prototypes are <a href="http://www.arminbwagner.com/audiokarte">still online</a> and - according to feedback I get from time to time - are still being used occasionally by teachers of a local school.

To test the possibilities of today, I took the shopworn code of the old prototype and combined it with Google's Polymer. Let's see what happens.
