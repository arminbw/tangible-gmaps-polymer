#Tangible GMaps Polymer

A few years ago (2008?) I was working on a toolset for teachers of visual impaired students. One goal was to ease the production of tangible maps.
To get something up an running fast, I set up a styled Google Maps page at the beginning, which served as the first image source.
These early prototypes are <a href="http://www.arminbwagner.com/audiokarte/info.html">still online</a> and - according to feedback I get from time to time - are still being used occasionally by teachers of a local school.

To test the possibilities of today, I took the shopworn code of the old prototype, combined it with Google's Polymer (version 1.0) and put it on Github. Let's see what happens.
